# CS-331-Group-5-Project

Objective
This project aims to demonstrate the encryption and decryption of a message
using AES encryption. This will show the different steps of AES encryption and highlight
how AES usage increases the security within a cyber system and ultimately provides
more safety for both online and offline authentication and authorization.
This project is both important and relevant to this course because it
demonstrates the importance of cryptography within cyber systems. Encryption provides
a crucial step for making it exponentially harder for malicious entities to use stolen data,
as only those with special knowledge of the keys are able to decrypt information. This
provides a massive amount of cyber security and safety for systems that utilize data that
is important to keep hidden from others.

Ultimately, this project addresses the problem of if data is intercepted by
malicious entities, they can just simply use that information to do whatever they want.
By encrypting and decrypting with AES, if attackers intercept data, they are ultimately
unable to use it because only those with specific knowledge of the keys are able to
decrypt and see what the information actually is. This project will provide more
information about the usage and importance of cryptosystems like AES.
Scope

This project is going to include a demonstration program showing the encryption
